My research focuses on Jejueo as spoken by elderly people in both Jeju and Osaka, Japan. I employ both experimental and naturalistic elicitation tools to better understand (a) Jejueo as a language and (b) differences between the Jeju and Osaka groups when it comes to Jejueo production and comprehension.
