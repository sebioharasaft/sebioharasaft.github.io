## Description
This is an introductory course that focuses on language endangerment, globalization, and indigenous peoples. Those in Hawaiâ€™i are likely familiar with the endangerment and then subsequent revitalization efforts for Hawaiian. Still, few understand that this is a global issue, not only a local one. In fact, there are around 7,000 languages in the world, and some linguists estimate that as many as half of these will become extinct by the end of this century. Therefore, the purpose of this course is to expose students to this gravity of this phenomenon on a global scale. Students will be introduced to case studies on language endangerment and revitalization from around the world and throughout history, from the viewpoints of both indigenous speakers and outsiders

Additionally, this is a [*Unit Mastery* (UM)](https://manoa.hawaii.edu/linguistics/self-directed-study-classes/) course. In Unit Mastery courses there are no in-person class meetings or lectures. Instead, students study the materials on their own, and then need to complete a series of quizzes and writing assignments throughout the semester, which determines their overall comprehension of the materials and final grade. Instructors of UM courses, therefore, are responsible for interfacing with students via online methods, curriculum development and improvement, and evaluating and providing feedback to students just like an in-person course.
