This was a joint presentation with colleague [Shirley Gabber](https://www.shirleygabber.com/) at the 12th Conference on Oceanic Linguistics ([COOL](https://sites.google.com/view/cool12tahiti/home)). The data used in this talk came out of a remote Field Methods course at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa in the Spring 2021 semester. Drawing on existing linguistic literature on Fijian languages, as well as elicitation sessions with a native Kubulau Fijian speaker, we described tense/aspect markers in Kubulau Fijian compared with those in Standard Fijian.
