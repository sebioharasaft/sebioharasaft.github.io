This talk took place during a 2-day [joint workshop](https://ninjaluhmlinguisticsworkshop2023.wordpress.com/) with the National Institute for Japanese Language and Linguistics (NINJAL) at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa. I discussed preliminary findings from field work conducted in Osaka, Japan, investigating elderly Jejueo speakers' ability to produce Jejueo lexical and verbal items.
