This was a joint presentation with [Scott Saft](https://olelo.hawaii.edu/khuok/limahana/scott-saft). Drawing on spoken data from Hawaiian-medium high school students, we discuss the Hawaiian used by these "new speakers". While this includes a discussion of code-switching with English, we also highlight the complex Hawaiian structures that they employ in their speech.
