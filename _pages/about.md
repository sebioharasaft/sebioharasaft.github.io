Welcome to my website. I am a PhD student in the [Linguistics Department](https://manoa.hawaii.edu/linguistics/) at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa. 

### Research
My research focuses on [Jejueo](https://sites.google.com/a/hawaii.edu/jejueo/home), a critically endangered language spoken primarily on Jeju Island, South Korea. In addition to Jeju Island, I have been doing fieldwork in Osaka, Japan, where there are small groups of elderly Jejueo speakers. I employ both experimental and naturalistic data collection methods in the field.

I have also done some work on the local variety of English spoken in Hawaiʻi, [Hawaiʻi English](/publications/hawaii-english). Read more about my research [here](/research).

### Teaching
I have been teaching at UHM since 2020. Find out more about the courses I've taught [here](/teaching).
